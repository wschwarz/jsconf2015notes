Altering the Real World in JS

Friday (5:00pm - Track A)

We can take our code out of the computer into the real world (ex: controlling LEDs)

Javascript is going to lead this process.

----Demo----GIFs----

Computer generated music - algo raves - live coding dj
javascript env for algo ravers - online IDE

Gibber
	a = Drums('x*o*x*o-')
	a.pitch = 0.5
	// vocoding
	speak = Speak({ pitch: 70, wordgap: 5 })
		.say.seq( ['J', 'S', 'Conf'], [1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/2].rnd())

	speak.pitch.seq([1,.8,1.2])...

a lot of sensors since mobile phones have a lot of sensors and everybody has phones

phones -> io -> gibber

a.pitch = phone.x

bluetooth beacons - broadcasting their existence | long battery life, cheap, urls, sensor values, etc.
	coming to a web browser bugzilla url

scanning for beacons
var adapter = navigator.mozBluetooth.defaultAdapter
adapter.startLeScan([]).then(function() {}); adapter.stopLeScan(handle)
get ids from bluetooth

JS baby monitor
	tag your baby with a phone
	get three beacons
	some math

http://janos.io

use signal strength for distance

phone music demo - change the speed of gifs - kinda crashed since there were too many connectors

combine demos to listen to baby generated music

Wearables
	augmented reality
	hyperlocal services
	open standards

mozilla glass -
	works with any glasses
	no extra device
	voice controlled
	self build kit ~$300
	webRTC connects camera and display & sensors / mirror - Augmented Reality
