Helping someone get up and running

Friday (12:45pm - Track B)


Good Readmes - README.md

Command Line tools - (automatically generate a list to add to your readme or group place?)

Comment - why your code is doing what it's doing.

Vagrant - easy to script virtualized environment for development
(hide the fact that you are using it.)

Nag your users?

How do you "test" the system? - Show them all the tools and test that it all works. (Dashboards, command-line args to shrink jobs or test edge-cases)

The ultimate drama - something about a promo code - js2015?
