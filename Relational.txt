Javascript on ACID

SQL - JS
Lots of differences
Similarities?
"Languages that will probably never die."

Node started with a lot of support for nosql

Problem: No set of DBAPI
Lack of transaction API,
Database specific stuff

KNEX.JS and Bookshelf.js

SQL as you would write it. knex.select('*').from('table').where({ field: 1}).then().catch();

Transactions
Snapshot state, ability to rollback, provent others from altering data as you're working with it. Tricky in Node.

Bookshelf - ORM
built on top of knex.

OpenRecord

Sequelize

Yeah Reinvent the wheel - Conversations after React are different. Different approach to some of this stuff
