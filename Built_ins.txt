Built ins

Friday (2:15pm Track-B)

self-hosting: implementing parts or the whole of a language runtime in the language itself.

what are built ins?
i.e. forEach, every, ArrayIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)

what is a shim? - A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.

A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.

you can knit javascript and c together when developing.

lodash - possible to get better then built-in performance (cutting features) add other features back-in and get better or equivalent perf.

Intl - internationalization API, implemented in JS (Edge).
	good
		simplified handling arguments
		simplified reading/understanding
		integrating w/ C++ was simple
	bad
		extra js functionality is exposed
		heavier boilerplate
		js has weird side-effects that have to be corrected for. (i.e. changing Object.prototype, keeping references)
	ugly
		preventing tainting of internal JS
		testing - (checking for the above is more difficult)
		ensure correct stack behavior
		you get leaks (you don't want to be able to see or modify your built-ins)

No silver bullet on performance (alternatives(natives) can and are often still faster)
Object.assign - ~60% faster than lib alternatives
v8 - Object.assign is ~62% slower. Different implementations can vary.

shakras? chakras? That's the win10 version that's super fast. Chakra (jscript engine) developed by microsoft for IE9. it JIT compiles on a seperate CPU than the browser

jperf.com - indexof vs vanilla (javascript natives)

developers shouldn't feel forced to use a lib to have faster built-in equivalents.
