Recreating a modem in JS

waveform + 01011
encoding problem

audible multiplexing - focus on one frequency and ignore everything else

FSK - frequency shift key. This allows us to encode state.

carrier signal, modulating sin wave signal, frequency modulating

AFSK -

TTY - teletype
non-skilled operators on both ends reading encoded messages.

string to bytes, bits to audio by encoding in waveform by shifting frequency.

baud rate - bits/second

extracting bits from the waveform. These set of bins equates to a bit.

need frequency
Goertzel - allows us to extract a (single) target frequency intentsity over time
analyzing the intensity isn't perfect but we want as close to binary as we can get.

use hamming window to remove noise (fourier transform).

Those high tones are our lead in to denote starting stop.
