Automated Testing 10:15 am (Track B)

Continuous Integration
	consistent, easily repeatable.

Servers are getting cheap.

Headless testing helps
	phantomjs
	envjs
	rhino
	rubyracer
	nodejs

Problem - What if your tech can't run on one of these?
	Some tech assume the presence of a GUI or web-browser

Case Study - Google Polymer (web components)
	web component tester assumes a GUI
	cloud based cli doesn't have them

Possible solutions
	Travis CI - xvfb Firefox (good documentation)
	Sauce Labs - Selenium cloud.

Enter X Virtual Frame Buffer - xvfb
	allows you to run GUI applications without a GUI
	uses X11 windows server

github.com/mdb/polymer-testing-box
github.com/mdb/nw-testing-box
	uses vagrant, ansible, bower and node

run against the display port that xvfb is running on.
(See if you can get this guys notes)

Need to run some commands to run stuff on the spun up VM box.
