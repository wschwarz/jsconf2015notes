Hybrid apps in backbone react

Friday (11am - Track B)

backbone
brunch

brunch is a build tool
chaplin has mediator (pub/sub) for between app communication

Big question: What could UI solve on its own?
	eliminate rerendering
	numerous api calls & hydrations

Solution: replacing backbone views with React

Migration Process
start with small components
use backbone/react mixin

convert your parent view to use React.createElement instead. This ties them together.

React Backbone Adapter. Pass in element, container, callback.
1) create, 2) identify, 3) attach, 4) render, 5) dispose

use a wrapper. root level react component extend the adapter

multiple models and collections as props

cjsx - coffeescript
babel is much more robust

implicit returns - remember to wrap a series of components in a parent div, otherwise it won't render

cjsx - event handlers will need to 'return false', otherwise react will screw up
